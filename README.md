## **_A one-stop platform for tracking all assets._**

Obviously alot of investment tracking apps are already out there. I had one on my phone as well but it only supported cryptocurrencies. Keeping track of all these different types of assets that are out there can be a challenging, if not daunting, task. It's important to routinely know whatâ€™s going on with all your investments. That's why I wanted to create a one-stop platform that supports all kinds of assets.

## **_Setup_**

Run $ npm i to install all packages that are required to run AssetsBalance.

After installation has finished run $ npm run start, your browser will open automatically displaying the home screen.
